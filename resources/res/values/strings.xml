Users can only access Google tools using accounts from the specified domains (to allow gmail or googlemail accounts, add consumer_accounts to the list of domains). This setting prevents users from signing in and adding a Secondary Account on a managed device that requires Google authentication, if that account doesn\'t belong to one of the explicitly allowed domains. Leaving this setting empty or unset means users can access Google Workspace with any account. Users cannot change or override this setting. Note: This policy causes the X-GoogApps-Allowed-Domains header to be appended to all HTTP and HTTPS requests to all google.com domains, as described in https://support.google.com/a/answer/1668854.</string>

When navigating away from a page, its current state (document tree, script, etc.) may be preserved in the back-forward cache. If the browser navigates back to the page, the page may be restored from the back-forward cache and displayed in the state it was in before being cached. This feature might cause issues for some websites that do not expect this caching. In particular, some websites depend on the \"unload\" event being dispatched when the browser navigates away from the page. The \"unload\" event will not be dispatched if the page enters the back-forward cache. If this policy is set to enabled or not set, the BackForwardCache feature will be enabled. If this policy is set to disabled then the feature will be force disabled.</string>

    <string name="0_resource_name_obfuscated_res_0x7f140018">This policy controls the sign-in behavior of the browser. It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to Google Chrome with their account and use account related services like Google Chrome Sync. If the policy is set to \"Disable browser sign-in\" then the user cannot sign in to the browser and use account-based services. In this case browser-level features like Google Chrome Sync cannot be used and will be unavailable. On iOS, if the user was signed in and the policy is set to \"Disabled\" they will be signed out immediately. On other platforms, they will be signed out the next time they run Google Chrome. On all platforms, their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will be preserved and still usable. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail. If the policy is set to \"Enable browser sign-in,\" then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser. On all platforms except iOS, the user is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user\'s account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Google Chrome Sync will be turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Google Chrome Sync, use the SyncDisabled policy. If the policy is set to \"Force browser sign-in\" the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to disabled. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556 . This option is not supported on Linux, Android or iOS. It will fall back to \"Enable browser sign-in\" if used. If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable browser sign-in in the Google Chrome settings and use it as they see fit.</string>

This policy allows admins to configure (per data-type) when data is deleted by the browser. This is useful for customers that work with sensitive customer data. The policy will only take effect if SyncDisabled is set to true. The available data types are \'browsing_history\', \'download_history\', \'cookies_and_other_site_data\', \'cached_images_and_files\', \'password_signin\', \'autofill\', \'site_settings\' and \'hosted_app_data\'. The browser will automatically remove data of selected types that is older than \'time_to_live_in_hours\'. The minimum value that can be set is 1 hour. The deletion of expired data will happen 15 seconds after the browser starts then every hour while the browser is running.</string>

This policy does not affect which DNS servers are used: if, for example, the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It also does not control if DNS-over-HTTPS is used; Google Chrome will always use the built-in resolver for DNS-over-HTTPS requests. Please see the DnsOverHttpsMode policy for information on controlling DNS-over-HTTPS. If this policy is set to Enabled, the built-in DNS client will be used, if available. If this policy is set to Disabled, the built-in DNS client will only be used when DNS-over-HTTPS is in use. If this policy is left unset, the built-in DNS client will be enabled by default on macOS, Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled) and Google Chrome OS.</string>

CECPQ2 results in larger TLS messages which, in very rare cases, can trigger bugs in some networking hardware. This policy can be set to False to disable CECPQ2 while networking issues are resolved. This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed in future versions of Google Chrome.</string>

    <string name="0_resource_name_obfuscated_res_0x7f140020">Configures support of CORS non-wildcard request headers. Google Chrome version 97 introduces support for CORS non-wildcard request headers. When scripts make a cross-origin network request via fetch() and XMLHttpRequest with a script-added Authorization header, the header must be explicitly allowed by the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response. \"Explicitly\" here means that the wild card symbol \"*\" doesn\'t cover the Authorization header. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5742041264816128 for more detail. If this policy is not set, or set to True, Google Chrome will support the CORS non-wildcard request headers and behave as described above. When this policy is set to False, chrome will allow the wildcard symbol (\"*\") in the Access-Control-Allow-Headers header in the CORS preflight response to cover the Authorization header. This Enterprise policy is temporary; it\'s intended to be removed in the future.</string>

Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn\'t be trusted (because they weren\'t properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the hash must meet one of these conditions: * It\'s of the server certificate\'s subjectPublicKeyInfo. * It\'s of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate in the certificate chain. That CA certificate is constrained through the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName has an organizationName attribute. * It\'s of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server\'s certificate has the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values. Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored. Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren\'t disclosed, then Google Chrome doesn\'t trust those certificates.</string>

Enterprise hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn\'t be trusted (because they weren\'t properly publicly disclosed). To turn off enforcement, the subjectPublicKeyInfo hash must appear in a CA certificate recognized as a Legacy CA. A Legacy CA is publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by Google Chrome, but not Android Open Source Project or Google Chrome OS. Specify a subjectPublicKeyInfo hash by linking the hash algorithm name, a slash and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. Base64 encoding format matches that of an SPKI Fingerprint. The only recognized hash algorithm is sha256; others are ignored.

While making it harder to detect misissued certificates, hosts can keep using certificates that otherwise wouldn\'t be trusted (because they weren\'t properly publicly disclosed). Leaving the policy unset means that if certificates requiring disclosure through Certificate Transparency aren\'t disclosed, then Google Chrome doesn\'t trust those certificates. A URL pattern follows this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blocklist-filter-format ). However, because the validity of certificates for a given hostname is independent of the scheme, port, or path, Google Chrome only considers the hostname portion of the URL.

Each named origin\'s process will only be allowed to contain documents from that origin and its subdomains. For example, specifying https://a1.example.com/ allows https://a2.a1.example.com/ in the same process, but not https://example.com or https://b.example.com. Note that Android isolates certain sensitive sites by default starting in Google Chrome version 77, and this policy extends that mode to isolate specific additional origins. Since Google Chrome 77, you can also specify a range of origins to isolate using a wildcard. For example, specifying https://[*.]corp.example.com will give every origin underneath https://corp.example.com its own dedicated process, including https://corp.example.com itself, https://a1.corp.example.com, and https://a2.a1.corp.example.com. Note that origins isolated by this policy will be unable to script other origins in the same site, which is otherwise possible if two same-site documents modify their document.domain values to match. Administrators should confirm this uncommon behavior is not used on an origin before isolating it. Setting the policy to Disabled turns off any form of site isolation, including isolation of sensitive sites and field trials of IsolateOriginsAndroid, SitePerProcessAndroid, and other site isolation modes. Users can still turn on IsolateOrigins manually, through the command line flag. Leaving the policy unset lets users change this setting.

If the policy is enabled and set to one or more domains, no lookalike warnings pages will be shown when the user visits pages on that domain. If the policy is not set, or set to an empty list, warnings may appear on any site the user visits. A hostname can be allowed with a complete host match, or any domain match.

These keys hold the bookmark\'s name and target. Admins can set up a subfolder by defining a bookmark without a \"url\" key, but with an additional \"children\" key. This key also has a list of bookmarks, some of which can also be folders. Chrome amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted through the address bar. For example, \"google.com\" becomes \"https://google.com/\". Users can\'t change the folders the bookmarks are placed in (though they can hide it from the bookmark bar). The default folder name for managed bookmarks is \"Managed bookmarks\" but it can be changed by adding a new sub-dictionary to the policy with a single key named \"toplevel_name\" with the desired folder name as its value.

This policy also prevents the origin from being labeled \"Not Secure\" in the address bar. Setting a list of URLs in this policy amounts to setting the command-line flag --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure to a comma-separated list of the same URLs.

Each item in the list requires both devices and urls fields for the policy to be valid. Each item in the devices field can have a vendor_id and product_id field. Omitting the vendor_id field will create a policy matching any device. Omitting the product_id field will create a policy matching any device with the given vendor ID. A policy which has a product_id field without a vendor_id field is invalid. The USB permission model will grant the specified URL permission to access the USB device as a top-level origin. If embedded frames need to access USB devices, the \'usb\' feature-policy header should be used to grant access. The URL must be valid, otherwise the policy is ignored. Deprecated: The USB permission model used to support specifying both the requesting and embedding URLs. This is deprecated and only supported for backwards compatiblity in this manner: if both a requesting and embedding URL is specified, then the embedding URL will be granted the permission as top-level origin and the requsting URL will be ignored entirely. This policy overrides DefaultWebUsbGuardSetting, WebUsbAskForUrls, WebUsbBlockedForUrls and the user\'s preferences. This policy only affects access to USB devices through the WebUSB API.
